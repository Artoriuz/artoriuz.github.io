        <p>
            This work aims to mathematically quantify image quality and performance of different real-time upscaling algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before attempting to reproduce, make sure to grab the latest version of <a href="https://mpv.io/">mpv</a> and updated user shaders. You can get 
            the shaders from <a href="https://github.com/bjin/mpv-prescalers">bjin</a> and <a href="https://github.com/igv/FSRCNN-TensorFlow/releases">igv (FSRCNNX)</a>/<a href="https://gist.github.com/igv">igv (SSSR)</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            UPDATE - 18/12/2018: Violet measurements have been updated with latest versions of FSRCNNX and Waifu2x. On top of that, I've included MS-SSIM and PSNR-HVS-M measurements. 
            I've also included all NGU algorithms from <a href="http://madvr.com/">MadVR</a> due to demand, though NGU-AA performs poorly due to half-pixel shifts.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I've not finished everything yet, Shuri's section will be updated soon.

        <h3 id="upscaling">What is upscaling?</h3>
        <p>
            Like its name implies, upscaling is simply increasing the scale of something. More specifically, taking discrete information
            in a given scale and finding values between the existing samples. The easiest and most classic way of doing this
            is through simple linear interpolation, if you want to find a value between two points you can simply draw a
            line between them and linearly find any value in this line. If you wanted to find the value that's placed exactly
            in the middle of those 2 discrete points, you could simply do an arithmetic mean with their values to find your
            answer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Linear interpolation can be done in a plane, through both axis, creating what we call "bilinear" interpolation. Bilinear
            interpolation is the simplest interpolation algorithm, easiest to calculate and also unironically the most used
            one in the industry due to the fact that it's extremely simple to implement.
        </p>
        <p>
            But can something as simple as just drawing a line between 2 known discrete points give us good results? It depends entirely
            on how the original information looked like. We can however, increase the complexity of our upscaling algorithm
            by increase the amount of information it takes into consideration in order to find values between our discrete
            points. In this page we'll evaluate what we can do differently, how much better our results can get and how it
            affects our performance.
        </p>
        <h3 id="polynomial">Polynomial interpolation</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="./images/mpv_upscaling/interpolation.png" alt="upscaling" class="center">
            <br>
            A relatively simple way of taking more information into consideration when finding values between discrete points is to use
            more than just the information of 2 points to calculate a function that connects them. We can trace a polynomial
            curve between points if we take into account the information of neighbouring elements, calculating the gradients
            and therefore becoming able to connect them with curves instead of lines. The shape of the curve connecting points
            depends on the windowing and scaling functions used.
        </p>
        <h3 id="SSSR">Structural Similarity Upscaling</h3>
        <img src="./images/mpv_upscaling/sssr_bilinear.png" alt="upscaling" class="center">
        <br>
        <img src="./images/mpv_upscaling/sssr_sssr.png" alt="upscaling" class="center">
        <p>
            We can more precisely upscale something if we try to reconstruct strucutures, the most evident problem with linear or polynomial
            scalers is the thickening of border areas where the interpolated result doesn't transit between values as sharply,
            resulting in a blurrier image with "lost" detail in the strucutures if you're downscaling and then upscaling
            it back.
        </p>
        <h3 id="neural">Convolutional Neural Networks</h3>
        <p>
            Another way of trying to "recover" lost information through upscaling is using neural networks that firstly go through a
            training phase so it can "learn" how to upscale. The training phase consists of analysing a set of images, and
            then setting parameters that will be used when upscaling. Note that upscaling isn't exactly recovering information, 
            all we're doing is coming up with "new" information based on what we already have.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are multiple different ways of using neural networks to upscale images, and there are multiple different algorithms
            that aim to do pretty much the same thing. To make it more practical, we'll stick to algorithms that can be easily
            tested as user-shaders using mpv, with the adition of the extremely popular Waifu2X and NGU from MadVR. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll test the following algorithms:
            <li><a href="https://github.com/bjin/mpv-prescalers">RAVU</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://avisynth.nl/index.php/Nnedi3">NNEDI3</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/igv/FSRCNN-TensorFlow">FSRCNNX</a></li>
            <li><a href = "http://madvr.com/">NGU(AA/SOFT/STANDARD/SHARP)</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x">Waifu2x</a></li>
        </p>
        
        <h3 id="methodology">Testing methodology</h3>
        <p>
            Performance measurements were done upscaling an animation video encoded into 8bit AVC from 1280x720 to 2560x1440. Utilising mpv
            with a benchmarking profile, always scaling chroma with spline36 (all settings from profile=gpu-hq), fixing scalers
            that do half-pixel shifts (with the exception of NGU-AA, since as far as I know there's no option to fix it in MadVR), 
            with Vulkan as the renderer and hardware decoding turned off. The machine used has
            an Ivy Bridge i5 3470, a Polaris RX 470 and user shaders were always compute shaders when possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Quality measurements were done in 2 test images, one from animation and another one from live action. Though keep in mind the live-action 
            results are currently outdated.
        </p>
        <a href="./images/mpv_upscaling/violet/reference.png">
            <img src="./images/mpv_upscaling/violet/reference.png" alt="Reference Violet" class="center" width="960" height="540">
        </a>
        <br>
        <a href="./images/mpv_upscaling/shuri/reference.png">
            <img src="./images/mpv_upscaling/shuri/reference.png" alt="Reference Shuri" class="center" width="960" height="404">
        </a>
        <p>
            The reasoning behind this comes from the fact that the live action image has more high frequency components that are harder
            to "restore". In order to measure how "good" each algorithm is, the test images were previously bicubic downscaled
            to a quarter of their original resolutions (0.5x scaling factor in both axes), and then upscaled back to their
            original resolutions with a direct 2x upscaling factor (2x in both axes outputs a resolution that's 4x larger in pixels). 
            Due to the fact that some scalers only work with YUV sources,
            to make it fair a relatively high quality YUV444 JPEG source was used for every single scaler. Note that using
            RGB24 PNGs with the algorithms that accept RGB sources would've been better, but also unfair.
        </p>
        <p>
            Performance was evaluated simply in frames per second, while quality was evaluated in 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio">PSNR</a>, 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity">SSIM</a>, 
            <a href="http://mrim.imag.fr/yubing.tong/Files_YubingTong/JIST4516-Accepted.pdf">PSNR-HVS-M</a> and

        <div w3-include-html="./html/shuri.htm"></div>
        <p>The same beheviour can be seen in Shuri's SSIM maps, Waifu2x was much closer to the reference than bilinear:</p>

        </p>
        <p>
            We can clearly see that in general, neural network based scalers tend to give better quality, though they're also more computationally
            expensive. SSSR however, does better than expected and sometimes can even beat FSRCNNX on the objective mathematical tests due to the fact that its output is generally "cleaner".
        </p>
        <p>
            NGU-AA performed horribly on the quality measurements due to half-pixel shifts, but all the other NGU algorithms were actually decent. NGU-STANDARD and NGU-SHARP are consistently 
            better than FRSCNNX and only really get beaten by Waifu2x, which is on its own league.  
        </p>
        <p>
            It would be amazing to be able to use Waifu2x in real-time, but it's impossible. Taking performance into consideration, at least on mpv FSRCNNX-8-0-4-1 seems to be the best 
            all-around option when you take into consideration objetive quality scores, my own subjective perception of it being visibly clearer than SSSR (but perhaps slightly dirtier 
            with more artifacts) and also because it performs amazingly well for the quality it gives. Ravu is visibly blurrier, NNEDI3 is beaten in everything, and FSRCCNX-16-0-4-1 isn't 
            worth the performance difference.  
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're using MadVR, I think both NGU-STANDARD and NGU-SHARP look awesome and you can choose whichever you like the most.
