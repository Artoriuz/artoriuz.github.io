        <p>
            This work aims to mathematically quantify image quality and performance of different real-time upscaling algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before attempting to reproduce, make sure to grab the latest version of <a href="https://mpv.io/">mpv</a> and updated user shaders. You can get 
            the shaders from <a href="https://github.com/bjin/mpv-prescalers">bjin</a> and <a href="https://github.com/igv/FSRCNN-TensorFlow/releases">igv (FSRCNNX)</a>/<a href="https://gist.github.com/igv">igv (SSSR)</a>.
        <p>
            UPDATE - 25/02/2019: Initial version of the Chroma section is added. I'll take some time to slowly polish it with more information and different tests, and I'm also probably going to add PSNR-HMA to the RGB tests soon.
        </p>
        </p>
            UPDATE - 20/02/2019: IW-SSIM tables added.
        <p>
            UPDATE - 19/02/2019: MS-SSIM tables fixed, code had issues with RGB -> greyscale conversion. 
        </p>
        <p>
            UPDATE - 18/02/2019: Lanczos added, and tables now display results from best to worst.
        </p>
        <p>
            UPDATE - 16/02/2019: Other EWA scalers were added.
        </p>
        <p>
            UPDATE - 22/12/2018: I found out a mistake in previous results, and have once again updated all quality comparison results.
            <br>
            I'm not certain about what was causing the problems, but turning off PNG filtering and debanding seems to have fixed it. I'll investigate which of the two was the culprit once I have the time. 
            <br>
            Well, since I had to redo everything, I took this opportunity to improve the testing methodology, debanding was turned off to prevent loss of detail, and I used a lossless 
            YUV444P AVC encode as upscaling source instead of a YUV444P JPEG.  
        </p>
        <p>
            UPDATE - 18/12/2018: Results have been updated with latest versions of FSRCNNX and Waifu2x. On top of that, I've included MS-SSIM and PSNR-HVS-M measurements. 
            I've also included all NGU algorithms from <a href="http://madvr.com/">MadVR</a> since people are interested on them, though NGU-AA performs poorly due to half-pixel shifts.

        <h3 id="upscaling">What is upscaling?</h3>
        <p>
            Like its name implies, upscaling is simply increasing the scale of something. More specifically, taking discrete information
            in a given scale and finding values between the existing samples. The easiest and most classic way of doing this
            is through simple linear interpolation, if you want to find a value between two points you can simply draw a
            line between them and linearly find any value in this line. If you wanted to find the value that's placed exactly
            in the middle of those 2 discrete points, you could simply do an arithmetic mean with their values to find your
            answer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Linear interpolation can be done in a plane, through both axis, creating what we call "bilinear" interpolation. Bilinear
            interpolation is the simplest interpolation algorithm, easiest to calculate and also unironically the most used
            one in the industry due to the fact that it's extremely simple to implement.
        </p>
        <p>
            But can something as simple as just drawing a line between 2 known discrete points give us good results? It depends entirely
            on how the original information looked like. We can however, increase the complexity of our upscaling algorithm
            by increase the amount of information it takes into consideration in order to find values between our discrete
            points. In this page we'll evaluate what we can do differently, how much better our results can get and how it
            affects our performance.
        </p>
        <h3 id="polynomial">Polynomial interpolation</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="./images/mpv_upscaling/interpolation.png" alt="upscaling" class="center">
            <br>
            A relatively simple way of taking more information into consideration when finding values between discrete points is to use
            more than just the information of 2 points to calculate a function that connects them. We can trace a polynomial
            curve between points if we take into account the information of neighbouring elements, calculating the gradients
            and therefore becoming able to connect them with curves instead of lines. The shape of the curve connecting points
            depends on the windowing and scaling functions used.
        </p>
        <h3 id="SSSR">Structural Similarity Upscaling</h3>
        <img src="./images/mpv_upscaling/sssr_bilinear.png" alt="upscaling" class="center">
        <br>
        <img src="./images/mpv_upscaling/sssr_sssr.png" alt="upscaling" class="center">
        <p>
            We can more precisely upscale something if we try to reconstruct strucutures, the most evident problem with linear or polynomial
            scalers is the thickening of border areas where the interpolated result doesn't transit between values as sharply,
            resulting in a blurrier image with "lost" detail in the strucutures if you're downscaling and then upscaling
            it back.
        </p>
        <h3 id="neural">Convolutional Neural Networks</h3>
        <p>
            Another way of trying to "recover" lost information through upscaling is using neural networks that firstly go through a
            training phase so it can "learn" how to upscale. The training phase consists of analysing a set of images, and
            then setting parameters that will be used when upscaling. Note that upscaling isn't exactly recovering information, 
            all we're doing is coming up with "new" information based on what we already have.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are multiple different ways of using neural networks to upscale images, and there are multiple different algorithms
            that aim to do pretty much the same thing. To make it more practical, we'll stick to algorithms that can be easily
            tested as user-shaders using mpv, with the adition of the extremely popular Waifu2X and NGU from MadVR. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll test the following algorithms:
            <li><a href="https://github.com/bjin/mpv-prescalers">RAVU</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://avisynth.nl/index.php/Nnedi3">NNEDI3</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/igv/FSRCNN-TensorFlow">FSRCNNX</a></li>
            <li><a href = "http://madvr.com/">NGU(AA/SOFT/STANDARD/SHARP)</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x">Waifu2x</a></li>
        </p>
        
        <h3 id="methodology">Testing methodology</h3>
        <p>
            Performance measurements were done upscaling an animation video encoded into 8bit AVC from 1280x720 to 2560x1440. Utilising mpv
            with a benchmarking profile, all settings from profile=gpu-hq, fixing scalers
            that do half-pixel shifts (with the exception of NGU-AA, since as far as I know there's no option to fix it in MadVR), 
            with Vulkan as the renderer and hardware decoding turned off. The machine used has
            an Ivy Bridge i5 3470, a Polaris RX 470 and user shaders were always compute shaders when possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Quality measurements were done in 2 test images, one from animation and another one from live action. Debanding was turned off to prevent loss of fine detail, and so was 
            mpv's PNG screenshot filtering. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The reasoning behind this comes from the fact that the live action image has more high frequency components that are harder
            to "restore". In order to measure how "good" each algorithm is, the test images were previously bicubic downscaled
            to a quarter of their original resolutions (0.5x scaling factor in both axes), and then upscaled back to their
            original resolutions with a direct 2x upscaling factor (2x in both axes outputs a resolution that's 4x larger in pixels). 
            Every single scaler was tested on an YUV444P lossless AVC encode, which can be found on the repository. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Performance was evaluated simply in frames per second, while quality was evaluated in 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio">PSNR</a>, 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity">SSIM</a>,

        <p>
            We can clearly see that in general, neural network based scalers tend to give better quality, though as expected they're also more computationally
            expensive. We can see that FSRCNNX is clearly the best scaler you can use on mpv when it comes to quality, and MadVR's NGU displays similar results.
        </p>
        <p>
            All NGU algorithms were tested on their highest quality presets (Very High), which was still fine on the RX470 but way more computationally expensive than FSRCNNX-8-0-4-1. 
            Performance of FSRCNNX-16-0-4-1 is also relatively okay, but the quality difference over its lighter variant is small. FSRCNNX-56-16-4-1 and FSRCNNX-GAN-FORSCIENCE-56-16-4-1 
            are not worth it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            NNEDI3, Ravu and SSSR are mostly pointless, in my opinion FSRCNNX-8-0-4-1 looks better, or sharper if you prefer to use this term, while performing extremely well. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're using MadVR, I think both NGU-STANDARD and NGU-SHARP look great as long as your system can handle them, and you can choose whichever you like the most.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I'm providing numerical test results to mathematically evaluate how those different algorithms perform, I strongly advise to take a look on how the upscaled images actually end up looking like. The viewer has his/her own preference regarding 
            different drawbacks like aliasing, ringing or blurring for example. Some people might prefer an algorithm that scores relatively poorly when compared to sharper choices, but you should please yourself while consuming your media.

        <h3 id="chroma">Chroma Upscaling</h3>
        <p>
            Chroma subsampling is a technique utilised to save bitrate/filesize without strongly sacrificing perceived quality, by taking into account how our eyes biologically work and how our brains interpret the information they're receiving. 
        </p>
        <p>
            With the rise of television broadcasting the recurring problem of bandwidth-heavy innovations rapidly making the electromagnetic spectrum "crowded" started to become problematic, the practical bands of low long-range attenuation 
            were becoming scarce and that would undoubteadly limit the amount of things we could have "over the air", which then lead the way to new bandwidth-saving techniques that aimed to reduce the required bandwidth as much as reasonably possible 
            without affecting the perceived quality of the service to the same extent.     
        </p>
        <p>
            Since we're more likely to perceive contrast/luminosity differecens than chromatic details, chroma-subsampling is simply the most basic way of throwing away some colouring information without sacrificing on luminosity resolution.
        </p>
        <p>To make this simple to understand, we can see a normal image below alongside its RGB planes:</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="column">

        </div>
        <p>Now, the same image alongside its YUV/YCbCr planes:</p>

            We can easily simulate how it would look like if it didn't have its entirely chromatic information available by simply downscaling the chroma planes to 1/4 of their original resolution (0.5x scaling factor) and then upscaling them back (2x scaling factor).
        </p>
        <p>
            It's important to see how much "blurrier" the chromatic planes look after this process, in other words, how much high frequency information they lost. 
        </p>

        <p>Can't notice the difference when you put it back to RGB? Well, that's the point. In any case, to make it possible for us to see, you can look at the image below, which is simply 128 plus the difference between the reference and the chroma subsampled version:</p>

        <p>From this simulation it's probably reasonable to understand why chroma upscaling isn't usually a big concern, it's just that you're unlikely to notice the difference on real content.</p>
        <p>
            With that in mind, we can proceed with the actual comparison. SSIM measurements can be ignored this time since the luma plane remains intact and therefore there are no significant gains to be made in structural similarity from switching the scaler.

            It's important to notice how the numerical difference between the scalers is much smaller when doing chroma measurements, and this is precisely why using a heavier scaler is usually not warranted unless the performance impact is negligible.

            On my system, running KrigBilateral on Vulkan makes no difference whatsoever since I have a CPU decoding bottleneck at around ~1200 FPS with or without it on a 720p 8bit AVC file. Running on ra_d3d11 with d3d11va hardware decoding, I go from ~1800 FPS to ~1150 FPS going from 
            lanczos to KrigBilateral. Running both FSRCNNX-8-0-4-1 and KrigBilateral at the same time gives me ~260 FPS on both d3d11 and Vulkan, with or without hwdec. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My personnal recommendation is that you should test it yourself to see if you can notice KrigBilateral's difference during playback, and use it if it doesn't really matter resource-wise (in the case your GPU is fine either way). Another sensible decision would be to 
            use it when you don't need luma upscaling, since then the only gains you can make are in chroma.

            This section is a WIP and I expect to add more tests and test-images in the future.
